chore: Update documentation with generic worker and database URLs

Replace hardcoded Cloudflare Worker and database URLs with generic placeholders across multiple documentation and configuration files:

- Update README.md with generic API base URL
- Modify app/config.ts to use a generic worker URL
- Replace specific URLs in Cloudflare migration and deployment documentation
- Update development and workflow documentation with generic URL templates
- Ensure consistent placeholder naming across project files
